# To request new features

Ideas are welcome! Create a new issue <a href="">here</a>.

# For developers

1. Integration an image visualization/manipulation API like IIIF to allow users to capture panels within figures rather than the entire figure as described here (level 2): https://elifesciences.org/labs/d6044799/dynamically-serving-scientific-images-using-iiif
2. Create domain handlers for more publisher websites or repositories. For example, pubmed: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed . The current PMC domain handler would be a great place to start for a handler for Pubmed.
